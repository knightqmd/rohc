# ROHC library - compress protocol headers(learning)

The ROHC library provides an easy and robust way for applications to reduce
their bandwidth usage on network links with limited capacity or expensive
costs. Headers of network packets are compressed with the ROHC protocol and
algorithms.

The ROHC protocol is very efficient for compressing VoIP streams that use RTP
as transport protocol. ROHC is also suitable for compressing IP-only (IPv4 or
IPv6), UDP or TCP flows and many others.

The ROHC library is intended for developers who want to reduce the bandwidth
requirements of their applications. Supported platforms include Linux, BSD,
Windows, and Android.

## License

The project is licensed under the GNU LGPL version 2.1 or later, see the
[COPYING](COPYING) and [AUTHORS.md](AUTHORS.md) files for more details.

Some network captures or small scripts used for testing are under the GNU GPL
version 2 or later.


## Sources organization

The sources of the ROHC library are located in the src/ subdirectory. They are
organized into subdirectories:
* `src/comp/` contains the sources of the ROHC compressor
  * `src/comp/schemes/` contains the sources of the compression schemes used
    by the ROHC compressor
* `src/decomp/` contains the sources of the ROHC decompressor
  * `src/decomp/schemes/` contains the sources of the compression schemes used
    by the ROHC decompressor
* `src/common/` contains the sources shared by the ROHC compressor and the ROHC
  decompressor
  * `src/common/protocols/` contains the definitions of some network headers.

The doxygen documentation is the main source of information to use the ROHC
library. The `examples` subdirectory also provides some examples.

See the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file to learn to build the ROHC library.


## Applications

Several applications are available in the `app/` subdirectory:
* `app/sniffer/` contains an application that allows developers to test the
  (de)compression of the ROHC library on any local network
* `app/stats/` contains an application that allows developers to compute some
  statistics about ROHC (de)compression of some network streams

See the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file to learn to build the ROHC applications.


## Python binding

As of version 2.0.0, a Python binding was added. It is not as CPU performant as
the C library, so it is only recommended for testing or rapid prototyping. See
the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file to learn building and installing the Python
binding.

The Python binding supports both Python 2.7 and Python 3.x.


## Tests

The `test/` subdirectory contains several test applications. See the
[INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file to learn how to use these tools.
